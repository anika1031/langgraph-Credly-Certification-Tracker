# Langgraph Cert Credit-point agent

# Goal 
To provide an automated way to track, validate, and assign points to professional certifications â€” from **Credly URLs** .

# User Interaction 
How Users Interact with the Agent

## Step 1:Submit a Query
Users can ask following types of questions:

Query Type 1: Check Credit Points for a Specific Badge (Expired)

User: "How many credit points can I get for https://www.credly.com/badges/e192db17-f8c5-46aa-8f99-8a565223f1d6?"

Agent Response: "Sorry, your cert has expired. So you won't get any credit points. 
But otherwise you would have stood to obtain 5 credit points for your Hashicorp Terraform Cert"

Query Type 2: Check Credit Points for a Valid Badge

User: "What about https://www.credly.com/badges/90ee2ee9-f6cf-4d9b-8a52-f631d8644d58?"

Agent Response: "I see that this is an AWS AI Practitioner cert. And it is still valid. 
So you can be granted 2.5 credit points for it."
